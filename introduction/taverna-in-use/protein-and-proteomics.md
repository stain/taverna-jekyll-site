Taverna is used by various projects and researchers for the analysis of proteins and proteomics:

 - [Anthrax analysis](/introduction/taverna-in-use/disease-research#analysis-of-anthrax-bacterium) - 
   identification of proteins secreted by bacteria>
 - [eFamily](/introduction/taverna-in-use/databases#efamily) - integrating data from different databases
 - [European Model for Bioinformatics Research And Community Education](http://www.mygrid.org.uk/mygrid-in-use/adoption-by-embrace)
      (EMBRACE) - calling services on a grid; recovering a database
 - [iSpider](/introduction/related-projects#ispider) - querying multiple data sources
 - [ProDom](#prodom) -running of Taverna workflows behind a portal to search a protein database

##ProDom

[ProDom](http://prodom.prabi.fr/) is a comprehensive database of protein domain families generated 
   from the global comparison of all available protein sequences. 
It was developed at the Rh√¥ne-Alpes Bioinformatics Center ([PRABI](http://www.prabi.fr/)).

ProDom is described in the [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gki034) 
   *The ProDom database of protein domain families: more emphasis on 3D * by Bru et al.

A Web-based front-end is [available](http://prodom.prabi.fr/prodom/current/html/form.php)
   to perform searches and comparisons on the content of the database.

Some of the queries used by the front-end make use of Taverna 
   [workflows](http://prodom.prabi.fr/prodom/current/html/webservices.html).
