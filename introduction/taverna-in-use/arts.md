Taverna has been used for the [composition of music][1] using Web services for synthesis.

##Composition of music##
[John Ffitch][2] and others at the University of Bath have developed a service-oriented composition environment
   for music.
The environment consists of three main components:
 - A suite of synthesis Web services that incorporate a selection of the basic atomic components required for
      sound creation and processing
 - A tool that gives a description of music in terms of the construction of the instruments
     (parameters, connections) and the score they will play on>
 - An “environment of use” that allows the connection and enactment of the synthesis services

Both [Triana][3] and Taverna have been tested as the environment of use.
