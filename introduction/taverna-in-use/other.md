##MOTEUR
                    
[MOTEUR](http://modalis.polytech.unice.fr/softwares/moteur/start) is a workflow enactor designed to run 
   Taverna 1.x workflows on a grid.  
Its main feature is to enable data, service and workflow parallelism during execution of the workflow.

MOTEUR allows the workflows to be run on an Enabling Grids for E-sciencE  
   ([EGEE](http://eu-egee-org.web.cern.ch/eu-egee-org/index.html)) or 
   [GRIDâ€™5000](https://www.grid5000.fr/mediawiki/index.php/Grid5000:Home) grid.

The workflows run by MOTEUR must be designed and edited using Taverna.

###Publications

MOTEUR is described in the [paper](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1400050.1400057)

##SIMDAT

The Grids for Industrial Product Development SIMDAT [project](http://www.simdat.org/) 
   involves a large number of European academic and commercial 
   [partners](http://www.simdat.org/partners_simdat.html).

The SIMDAT project takes industrial product and process development forward by introducing advanced Grid technology 
   in the automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical and meteorological domains.

Under the SIMDAT project, a [GRIA](http://www.gria.org/) 
   [plugin](http://www.gria.org/documentation/5.2/manual/gria-workflow-plugins-for-taverna/installation/?searchterm=taverna)
   was developed for Taverna to allow Taverna workflows to access services on a grid.

###Publications

Some of the work within SIMDAT is detailed in the 
   [paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4031069) 
   *Grid-Enabled Workflows for Industrial Product Design* by Ghanem et al.
