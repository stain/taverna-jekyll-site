Taverna is used by various projects and researchers for investigations into systems biology:

 - [ENFIN – Enabling Systems Biology](/introduction/taverna-in-use/biology#enfin) – 
      calling of wrapped tools within workflows
 - [Manchester Centre for Integrative Systems Biology](/introduction/taverna-in-use/biology/manchester-centre-for-integrative-systems-biology/)
      (MCISB) – modelling metabolomic pathways
 - [Systems Biology Operational Software](/introduction/taverna-in-use/biology#sb-os) 
      (SB.OS) – a live DVD based on Ubuntu Linux that comes with a comprehensive list of Systems Biology Software 
      (including Taverna)
 - [MetWare](#metware) - applications, databases and workflows for metabolomics
 - [Tav4SB](/introduction/taverna-in-use/biology#tav4sb) - Taverna workflows for systems biology, 
      in particular for analysis of the kinetic models of biological systems
 - [CCPN](/introduction/taverna-in-use/biology#ccpn) - Taverna is used to encapsulate and combine protocols between 
      WeNMR (Worldwide e-Infrastructure for NMR and structural biology) portals and CCPN's 
     (Collaborative Computing Project for NMR) software.

##MetWare

The MetWare project provides applications, databases and workflows for metabolomics. 
The MetWare project is a collaboration between several metabolomics groups in the Netherlands and Germany.

The work involving Taverna workflows is done by 
   [Steffen Neumanns group (Bioinformatics &amp; Mass Spectrometry)](http://www.ipb-halle.de/en/research/stress-and-developmental-biology/all-staff/).

They developed a Web-based player of Taverna workflows and also have uploaded their workflows on myExperiment at 
   <http://www.myexperiment.org/users/937/workflows>.
