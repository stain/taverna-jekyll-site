- [Plymouth Marine Laboratory][1] using Taverna to orchestrate geoinfomatics and OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium)
     Web services such as WPS (Web Processing Service)

##PML##
The [Plymouth Marine Laboratory][2] (PML) provides capability for observing, modelling, understanding and
   forecasting marine ecosystems, to underpin evidence-based environmental solutions to societal challenges.

They are now using Taverna to orchestrate geoinfomatics and OGC (Open Geospatial  Consortium) Web services such as
  WPS (Web Processing Service).
The work has been described in the following paper, to be published in a special issue of computers &amp;
  geosciences concerning Web service orchestration:
["WPS orchestration using the Taverna workbench: The eScience approach"][3]

They have also developed a Web based graphical editor based on the [WireIt API][4].
It will be used in conjunction with the Taverna  Server allowing as a Web-based orchestration engine.
This Web editor will be included in the future European Marine Information  System (EUMIS) pilot,
part of the [NETMAR][5] project.
