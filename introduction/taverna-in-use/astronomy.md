Taverna and [myExperiment][1] are being used for astronomy research by several projects:

 - [AstroGrid][2] - plugin to allow AstroGrid utilities within Taverna 1.x
 - [HELIO][3] - workflows including heliophysical services
 - [SAMPO][4] - development of a workflow system based upon Taverna

##AstroGrid##
The UK’s [AstroGrid][5] is a ~£14M (over the period 2001-2009) project aimed at building a data-grid for UK
   astronomy, which will form the UK contribution to a global VirtualObservatory.

A [Taverna 1.x processor][6] has been written to enable client-site AstroGrid utilities to be included within
   Taverna workflows.

##SAMPO##
The SAMPO [project][10] was part of the ongoing Finnish contribution to the [European Southern Observatory][11].

Based upon Taverna, the SAMPO project developed the Recipe Flexible Execution workflow system [ESO Reflex][12].
ESO Refex allows users to connect together C programs that reduce the raw data produced by ESO instruments.

###Publications###
The [paper][13] *ESO Reflex: A Graphical Workflow Engine for Running Recipes* by Hook et al, describes the
   ESO Reflex workbench.
