Education and training in the use of the Taverna tools is provided in a number of different ways.
There are dedicated workshops, [online tutorials](/documentation/tutorials), 
[presentations and publications](http://dev.mygrid.org.uk/wiki/display/about/Publications).

Over fifty tutorials have been given on the use of Taverna, training over 1000 people
by Apache Taverna committers and third-parties.

As a community, we are always keen to help with training and tutorials for 
users and workshops for developers. 
Please [get in touch](/community) if you want to arrange a training or a workshop.
