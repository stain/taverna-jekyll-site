Galaxy is an open, Web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research. 
Taverna 2-Galaxy integration is a first step towards making [Galaxy](http://galaxy.psu.edu/)
   and Taverna 2 more interoperable. 
It allows the automatic generation of Galaxy tools from Taverna workflows. 
The tools can then be installed as usual in a Galaxy server and allow the Taverna workflows to 
become part of a Galaxy pipeline. 
It has been developed by Kostas Karasavvas of [NBIC](http://www.nbic.nl/).

Users do not need to install Taverna Galaxy themselves. 
It is available as part of the myExperiment [Web site](http://www.myexperiment.org/). 
While browsing Taverna workflows the user will see an additional link 
   “Download as Galaxy Tool” in the download section of the workflow. 
The tool can then be installed into Galaxy in the usual manner by the Galaxy administrator. 
They will also need a [Taverna Server](/documentation/server/) that will run the 
  Taverna Galaxy tools.

Also check out the Taverna-Galaxy [wiki](https://trac.nbic.nl/elabfactory/wiki/eGalaxy).

###For Taverna-Galaxy users

 - You can now include Taverna workflows as part of your Galaxy workflows
 - The Taverna workflow will be made available as a Galaxy tool
 - You can [search/browse](http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows) Taverna workflows from the 
     [myExperiment](http://www.myexperiment.org/) workflow repository, and
 - Just let your Galaxy administrator know which Taverna workflows you want installed in Galaxy

###Try it out

 - The [NBIC Galaxy Server](http://galaxy.nbic.nl) provides a demo platform to run some 
      pre-installed Taverna workflows in Galaxy

###Taverna-Galaxy in use

Dr Casey Bergman and his group of Life Sciences researchers from the 
   [Bergman Lab](http://bergmanlab.smith.man.ac.uk) @ University of Manchester working on 
   eukaryotic genome biology have successfully installed and used the integrated Taverna-Galaxy 
   tools.

See [their blog](http://bergmanlab.smith.man.ac.uk/?p=943) about their experiences in 
   installing and running Taverna-Galaxy.
