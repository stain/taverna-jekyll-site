A service set is a collection of services that have something in common, 
   for example a compatible functionality or suitability for a domain.

You can save the set of services that are in the 
   [Service Panel](/documentation/glossary#service_panel) of the Workbench by right-clicking on 
   *Available Services* in the Service Panel.

You can add a set of services to the Service Panel by right-clicking on *Available Services*. 
The service set can either be specified in a file, or downloaded from a URL on the Web that 
   points to the service description file. 
You have the choice to replace your current set of services, or to add to your set of services.

Note that the service templates and local services are not removed when you replace your service 
   set.
