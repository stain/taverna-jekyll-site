The Institute for Information Transmission Problems of Russian Academy of Sciences 
  ([IITP](http://www.iitp.ru/en/about)) in Moscow, Russia are developing a Web application called 
  [Taverna Online](http://onlinehpc.com/) to allow the creation and running of Taverna workflows from a Web browser.

Try [Taverna Online](http://onlinehpc.com/) out!

The workflows are created using the [mxgraph](http://www.jgraph.com/mxgraph.html)
   Javascript library and are run on a [Taverna Server](/documentation/server).

You can view a QuickTime 
   [movie](http://www.taverna.org.uk/pages/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/demo-metagenomics-merged.mp4) 
   showing the current state of Taverna Online.
