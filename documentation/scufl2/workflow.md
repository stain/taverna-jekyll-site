The definition of a workflow, its processors, inputs/outputs and links.

 - Bundle path: `/workflow/\$name.n3`

Each nested workflow (and nested nested workflows etc.) exists in a separate file within the `/workflow/` folder in the bundle.
The bundle's [research object](/documentation/scufl2/bundle) defines what is the top level workflow.

##Identifier

Each workflow **must** have a unique name within the bundle's workflow files.
The base part of the file name (excluding extension) **must** match the **scufl2:name** of the workflow.

Workflows used in a particular research object are globally identified as
   `<http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/researchObject/$uuid/workflow/$workflowName/>` -
   for instance `<http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/researchObject/28f7c554-4f35-401f-b34b-516e9a0ef731/workflow/Helloworld/>`.

As it can be useful to identify nested workflows included in several workflow bundles,
   each workflow must also have a *scufl2:workflowIdentifier* property, which URI **must** be on the form
   `<http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/workflow/$uuid>`, for example
   `<http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/workflow/efb1cdcd-1e19-408a-885a-303c6553a672/>`.
It is responsibility of the software creating or modifying the workflow to generate a new workflowcIdentifier
   as soon as the workflow has changed.
(The randomly generated UUID of the workflow must **not** match the UUID of a research object or any other workflow.)
The owning [research object](/documentation/scufl2/bundle) should then also be assigned a new UUID.
(Note that editing metadata and bindings in other files don't update the workflow, but still update the research object.)

The workflow file **should** set the ``@base` to the form `workflow/$name` 
so that nested resources can be referenced relatively, like `processor/$processorName`.

##Example

(Outdated)

    @base &lt;workflow/Helloworld/&gt;
    @prefix scufl2: &lt;http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/scufl2/ontology/&gt; .

    &lt;&gt;
        a scufl2:Workflow ;
        scufl2:name &quot;Helloworld&quot; ;
        scufl2:inputWorkflowPort &lt;in/yourName&gt; ;
        scufl2:outputWorkflowPort &lt;out/results&gt; ;
        scufl2:datalink &lt;datalink/1&gt;, &lt;datalink/2&gt; ;
        scufl2:processor &lt;processor/Hello&gt; .
    ]]>

This example defines the workflow "HelloWorld".
It contains one workflow input port and one workflow output port, in addition to a single processor and two datalinks.

The nested resources for this workflow, such as InputWorkflowPort , OutputWorkflowPort,
   [DataLink](/documentation/scufl2/datalink), Processor and their children **should** be described
   in the same file as the workflow itself.
Additional metadata should be added to an `/annotations/` file.

##Properties

 - **scufl2:name** (required) gives the programmatic short-name for this workflow within this bundle.
   This must be unique among the other workflows.
 - **scufl2:workflowIdentifier** (required) gives the globally unique URI defining this workflow.
   See *Identifier* above.
 - **scufl2:inputWorkflowPort** (optional) All workflow input ports defined for this workflow.
 - **scufl2:outputWorkflowPort** (optional) All workflow output ports defined for this workflow.
 - **scufl2:datalink** (optional) All [datalinks](/documentation/scufl2/datalink)
      defined between workflow and processor ports in this workflow.
   (Note that if this is a nested workflow, its outside links are defined in the parent workflow)
 - **scufl2:processor** (optional) All [processors](/documentation/scufl2/processors) in this workflow.

##Bundle links

All nested workflow resources should also be defined in the same archive file as this workflow.
Their URIs **must** be relative to this workflow, their type and **scufl2:name**.
So for instance &lt;workflow/Helloworld/processor/Hello&gt; is a **scufl2:Processor** in &lt;workflow/Helloworld&gt;,
   and has a **scufl2:name** "Hello".
