The definition of a processor.

- Bundle path: `/workflow/\$workflowName.n3`

Processors should be described in the same file as their containing
   [workflow](/documentation/scufl2/workflow).

##Identifier

Each processor **must** have a **scufl2:name**, which uniquely identifies this processor within its owning workflow.

Processors are globally identified as
   `<http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/researchObject/$researchId/workflow/$workflowName/processor/$processorName/>` -
   for instance  
   `<http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/researchObject/28f7c554-4f35-401f-b34b-516e9a0ef731/workflow/Helloworld/processor/Hello/>`.

Within the workflow bundle the processors should be linked to relatively, for instance `<processor/Hello>`
  within a workflow file, or `<workflow/Helloworld/processor/Hello>` within a profile file.

##Example

workflow/Helloworld.n3: (Outdated)

    @base &lt;workflow/Helloworld/&gt;
    @prefix scufl2: &lt;http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/scufl2/ontology/&gt; .

    &lt;processor/Hello&gt; a scufl2:Processor ;
        scufl2:name &quot;Hello&quot; ;
        scufl2:inputProcessorPort &lt;processor/Hello/in/name&gt; ;
        scufl2:outputProcessorPort &lt;processor/Hello/out/greeting&gt; ;
        scufl2:dispatchStack &lt;http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/scufl2/taverna#defaultDispatchStack&gt; ;
        scufl2:iterationStrategyStack (&lt;processor/Hello/iterationStrategy/0&gt;) .

    &lt;processor/Hello/in/name&gt; a scufl2:InputProcessorPort ;
        scufl2:name &quot;name&quot;;
        scufl2:portDepth 0 ;
        scufl2:granularPortDepth 0 .

    &lt;processor/Hello/out/greeting&gt; a scufl2:OutputProcessorPort ;
        scufl2:name &quot;greeting&quot; .
    ]]>

This example defines the processor "Hello" in the workflow "Helloworld".
It contains one processor input port "name" and one processor output port "greeting".
Additionally the processor has a dispatch stack and an iteration strategy stack.

The nested resources for this workflow, such as InputProcessorPort, OutputProcessorPort, DispatchStack,
  IterationStrategyStack and their children **should** be described in the same file as owning workflow itself.
Additional metadata should be added to an `/annotations/` file.

##Properties

 - **scufl2:name** (required) gives the programmatic short-name for this processor within this particular workflow.
   This must be unique among the other processors.
 - **scufl2:inputProcessorPort** (optional) All processor input ports defined for this processor.
 - **scufl2:outputProcessorPort** (optional) All processor output ports defined for this processor.
 - **scufl2:dispatchStack** (optional) The dispatch stack for this processor.
 - **scufl2:iterationStrategyStack** (optional) The IterationStrategyStack, required if more than 1 input is connected

##Bundle links

All nested processor resources should also be defined in the same archive file as this workflow.
Their URIs **must** be relative to this processor, their type and **scufl2:name**.
So for instance &lt;processor/Hello/out/greeting&gt; is a **scufl2:OutputProcessorPort** in &lt;processor/Hello&gt;,
   and has a **scufl2:name** "greeting".
